## Text classification using CNN

### Background
I have been working on various NLP related projects for a long time as part of my daily work. The work mostly revolves around data analytics, gold-standard creation, manual annotation which then leads to applying traditional methods for many Named Entity recognition tasks. These work-related activities can broadly categorized as classificaiton tasks. However, the process of manual annotation has been the most resource intensive step.

The recent developments have changed the landscape of NLP, specifically with [the release of BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert). Although I have graduate level training in ML, this is my effort to see how I can educate myself about deeplearning. This training from JovianML has definetly helped me take a good step toward acheiving that goal.

### The Problem 

Given that I had to start somewhere and that I did not want to chew off too much, I picked sentiment analysis, a classification problem. Whew! I know have narrowed down to a topic, this is great I though until I searched for "sentiment" on [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=sentiment). I decided to go with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) to analyze given that it had 1.6 million examples and 2 classes (or three).

In essense, the problem statement is to classify tweets as **negative** or **positive**
